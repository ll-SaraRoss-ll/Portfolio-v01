# 🌱 My First Portfolio – The Beginning of My Coding Journey

Welcome to the very first website I ever built and uploaded to GitHub!  
This portfolio represents the *start* of my path as a developer and designer—simple, functional, and full of motivation to grow.

## 🛠️ Built With
- HTML
- CSS

## 🎯 Purpose
This was my first public-facing project. I wanted to:
- Practice structuring a low-fidelity web page
- Explore what it means to publish and share code openly
- Motivate myself to improve through visibility and feedback

## ⚡ Features
- Basic multi-section layout
- Custom styling with CSS
- Responsive structure (on basic screens)

## 🖼️ Preview

## 🔗 Live Demo

> Replace the `#` with your actual hosted link (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).  
Need help publishing it? I can walk you through the steps!

## ✨ What’s Next
This version will stay here as a milestone.  
I’m currently working on a new, fully responsive portfolio with enhanced UI, projects, and interactivity.  
Stay tuned for the evolution!

## 🙌 Feedback Welcome
As this marks the beginning, I’d love any feedback—whether technical or visual. Every comment helps me grow.
